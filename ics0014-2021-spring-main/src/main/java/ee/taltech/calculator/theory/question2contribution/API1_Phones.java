    //     * All classes are available in classes package
    //     * If you want to test these practical assignments add these to your project.
    //       Example: If you Application.java is in the package ee.taltech, make sure theory is in package ee.taltech as well (ee.taltech.theory)

    //todo practical assignment
    // Management wants to define an API endpoint so frontend can display data about phones (think phone e-shop)
    // A Add necessary annotations to this class so this class can serve data
    // B Add a method to query all the phones (method content is not important - I am grading urls, annotations, names, and parameters)
    // C Add a method to query a single phone by it's unique identifier (method content is not important - I am grading urls, annotations, names, and parameters)
    // D Modify an existing method to query/filter phones by manufacturer while keeping existing functionality
    // E Modify an existing method to query/filter phones by release year while keeping existing functionality

    //todo theoretical assignment
    // F write pseudocode for saving a new phone (add annotations or http method names, urls, necessary parameters)
    // G write pseudocode for updating existing phone (add annotations or http method names, urls, necessary parameters)
    // H write pseudocode for deleting a phone (add annotations or http method names, urls, necessary parameters)
