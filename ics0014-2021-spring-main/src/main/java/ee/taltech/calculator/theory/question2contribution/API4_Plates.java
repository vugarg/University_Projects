    // Management wants to define an API endpoint so frontend can display data about plates (think designer plates e-shop)
    // A Add necessary annotations to this class so this class can serve data
    // B Add a method to query all the plates (method content is not important - I am grading urls, annotations, names, and parameters)
    // C Add a method to query a single plate by it's unique identifier (method content is not important - I am grading urls, annotations, names, and parameters)
    // D Modify an existing method to query/filter plates by size while keeping existing functionality
    // E Modify an existing method to query/filter plates by designer while keeping existing functionality

    //todo theoretical assignment
    // F write pseudocode for saving a new plate (add annotations or http method names, urls, necessary parameters)
    // G write pseudocode for updating existing plate (add annotations or http method names, urls, necessary parameters)
    // H write pseudocode for deleting a plate (add annotations or http method names, urls, necessary parameters)
