    //  The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go

    //todo A
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    // 6

    //todo B
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // Java seems like a really fun language I would like to learn more about it if I have time to focus in it more
    //

    //todo C
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // I didnt like that we are rushing this course in half semester, not good in perspective that we cant learn much.
    // I am pretty sure most of us will forget everything we learned here by next semester

    //todo D
    // Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    // Make this course full semester and focus more on fundementals please, I am not a pro coder and some terms
    // and concepts might be very obvious and easy for medium experience people but for me I have to go do shit tone of research.
    // dont get be wrong but I am also working 45 hours a week plus other studies trying to get the tuition fee for my uni
    // cry emoji :'(
